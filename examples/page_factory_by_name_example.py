# Notionary: Page Lookup Example
===============================

This example demonstrates how to locate an existing Notion page
using the NotionPageFactory.

It showcases the easiest way to access a page by its name,
but also mentions alternatives like lookup by ID or URL.

IMPORTANT: Replace "Jarvis fitboard" with the actual name of your page.
The factory uses fuzzy matching to find the closest match.
