Notion supports standard Markdown with some special extensions for creating rich content.

# Understanding Notion Blocks

Notion documents are composed of individual blocks. Each block has a specific type (paragraph, heading, list item, etc.) and format.
The Markdown syntax you use directly maps to these Notion blocks.

CRITICAL USAGE GUIDELINES:

1. Do NOT start content with a level 1 heading (# Heading). In Notion, the page title is already displayed in the metadata, so starting with an H1 heading is redundant. Begin with H2 (## Heading) or lower for section headings.

2. INLINE FORMATTING - VERY IMPORTANT:
   ✅ You can use inline formatting within almost any block type.
   ✅ Combine **bold**, _italic_, `code`, and other formatting as needed.
   ✅ Format text to create visual hierarchy and emphasize important points.❌ DO NOT overuse formatting - be strategic with formatting for best readability.

3. BACKTICK HANDLING - EXTREMELY IMPORTANT:
   ❌ NEVER wrap entire content or responses in triple backticks (`).   
❌ DO NOT use triple backticks (`) for anything except CODE BLOCKS or DIAGRAMS.
   ❌ DO NOT use triple backticks to mark or highlight regular text or examples.
   ✅ USE triple backticks ONLY for actual programming code, pseudocode, or specialized notation.
   ✅ For inline code, use single backticks (`code`).
   ✅ When showing Markdown syntax examples, use inline code formatting with single backticks.

4. BLOCK SEPARATION - IMPORTANT:
   ✅ Use empty lines between different blocks to ensure proper rendering in Notion.
   ✅ For major logical sections, use the spacer element (see documentation below).
   ⚠️ While headings can sometimes work without an empty line before the following paragraph, including empty lines between all block types ensures consistent rendering.

5. CONTENT FORMATTING - CRITICAL:
   ❌ DO NOT include introductory phrases like "I understand that..." or "Here's the content...".
   ✅ Provide ONLY the requested content directly without any prefacing text or meta-commentary.
   ✅ Generate just the content itself, formatted according to these guidelines.
