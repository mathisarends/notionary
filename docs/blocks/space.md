Spacing blocks allow you to add extra vertical space between content in your Notion pages. This is useful for visually separating sections, creating breathing room, or emphasizing breaks in your documents.

## How to Create Spacing Blocks

There are two ways to create a spacing block:

### 1. Double Empty Line

Simply add two consecutive empty lines in your markdown. The second empty line will be converted into a spacing block (an empty paragraph block) for visual separation.

```markdown
First paragraph

Second paragraph (normal spacing)


Third paragraph (extra space above from double empty lines)
```

### 2. Explicit `[space]` Marker

You can also use the explicit `[space]` marker anywhere in your markdown to insert a spacing block:

```markdown
First paragraph

[space]

Second paragraph (extra space above)
```

## Why Use Spacing Blocks?

Spacing blocks are a cross-cutting concept in Notionary. They:
- Improve readability and structure
- Allow for natural markdown authoring (just add extra blank lines)
- Work in all block contexts (paragraphs, lists, columns, etc.)

## Reference

See [Paragraphs](./paragraph.md) for how spacing interacts with normal content blocks.
